This is my take and notes on different features of RxJS.

Usually we will find RxJS being used in an Angular, Node, React etc kind of project,which already have a transpiler built in. So in that case, you would be able to use Import, Export etc ES6 features. 

Here, all I am using is an index file, with RxJS being inserted using a cdn. It works similar to lodash or jquery. So just like Lodash provides an '_' or Jquery provides '$' to access, similarly Rxjs provides 'rxjs'. We can destructure it to access the methods and features.
